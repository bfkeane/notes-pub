p4. On private NTP subnet, one or more servers may be primary = own timescale.
p5. Methinks NTP security on private subnet is not an issue.
p6. For ms accuracy, client/server updates every 15min.
    For 10x less accuracy, 1 1/2 days.
p7. NTP = gigantic DSP. Filter: trimmed mean & median methods.
p8. Selection algorithm: truechimers vs falsetickers.
    Clock discipline algo: NTP minimizes T & R (time & freq offsets).
    Discipline ftns as feedback loop: measure offset, adj sysclk time & freq.
    Design parameter: time constant ie responsiveness to time/freq variations,
       which depends on client poll interval ~ 15min.
p9. Limits of NTP:
      Intrinsic freq error <= 500ppm.
      34-year limit (2^30 seconds) vs Unix clk=1970. Since NTP can't determine
          era nbr, hence need for ntpdate, eh?
p12. Basically NTP occasionally reads server clk to tell if local clk is
     fast/slow and nudges the clk oscillator like Big Ben timekeepers.
p17. Ordinry cmptr clk = quartz osc VS radio/satellite or calibrated atomic clk.
     Access ctls selectively allow/dny reqs and limit req service rate.
p19. NTP can determine era via file timestamp.
p20. Processes: 
		poll & peer processes: theta, delta.
		clk filter process: select best from prev 8
		selection process:  truechimers vs falsetickers.
		clustering process: select on basis of stats.
		combining: weighted avg of 3 candidates offsets.
			weighting = quality metric = sync (aka root) distance.
		result = sysclk offset wrt server pop
	results processed by (feedback) loop filter: incr adjustments every 1sec
	NTP subnet = forest of trees: root distance=distance to primary srvrs.
 	Distributed Bellman-Ford routing algo = minimizes root distances.
p21. Unix adjtimex() to nudge sysclk. Typical temp coeff = 1 ppm / degC.
p22. Your NTP nodes should only ever run as clients.
     Client config file specifies persistent associations.
     3 modes: client/server (pull), symmetric, bdcast (push).
p23. Bdcast mode: (server?) config file specifies subnet address.
		srvr gens msg every ~minute
		client responds after random interval;
		client polls srvr using burst feature.
p24. Burst (batch) of msgs (over single connection?): 
	"client sets the clk w/in 10s after 1st msg."
p24. Auto discovery: NTP pool. DNS server returns 15 randomly selected srvrs.
p26. Critically damped response characteristic. Undersampling can be disastrous.
p27.	time offset > 1000s:
		NTP panics: tells operator to manually set clock.
	time offset < 128ms:
		slew clk (amortize offsets) at 1sec intervals
	time offset > 128ms:
		step clk (lesser of 2 evils: bc limit on slewing < 500ppm)
        <wiki/Slew: tiny adjs in clk freq to adjust for clk skew>
p29. Error: deterministic (measurable, correctable) vs non-det.
	Dispersion = freq offset, clk reading precision. Grows between updates.
	Kernel API: max error vs expected error.
	 max error = Root distance = server-vs-client <= RTT + dispersion.
	expected error = system jitter = non-deterministic.
p38. Drift = 1st derivative of freq.
	Wander = RMS diff between series of freq offsets.
	Jitter = RMS diff between series of time offsets.
	t = epoch, T(t) = time displayed by a clk
p40. Association = peer + poll processes. Mobilizing = birth, demob=death.
	Undying assoc = persistent (vs preemptable or ephemeral).
	Pkt in -> cmp with sysclk -> groomed -> clk displine=LPfilter.
	ACL entry = {IP, mask, capability}.
p41	Crytographic (pubkey or symmetric key) checks.

p81. Selecting sources: root distance = root dispersion + .5 * root delay.	
     Selection & combining algos use root distance metric.
     Clustering algo sorts by stratum then by root distance.
p81.	stratum 2: Corporate/campus backbone routers = 
	stratum 3: Dept srvrs
	stratum 4: Workstations, PC using unicast or bdcast modes. <-
p84. Cisco routers (no TOY chip): panic threshold set to 0.     
	See: http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.1/ntpd.htm?advanced=on
p85. Use iburst=1 with poll intervals on the order of hours.     
p88. Heavily loaded machines are not best choice for NTP server.

	See: http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.1/ntpd.htm?advanced=on
Use iburst: "initial delay to set the clock can be reduced".
With ntpd -gq ("one-time mode ntpd"), is ntpdate necessary?
"Freq Discpline": Does ntp.drift exist?
"Operating Modes" para 1: "can operate in a one-time mode" requires ntp.drift?
   para 3: iburst: "set in about a minute".
Configuration options (confopt.htm):
  'server' command specifies persistent client mode assoc with server.
  "Authentication Support" para 5: "acceptable to disable authentication":
  use IP addresses instead of host names.
