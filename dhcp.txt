If client set-emac-addr fails, then maybe that would cause your failures?
Or maybe there's a race wherein dhclient uses orig emac addr even though
set-emac-addr has just modified it.
Does client recv NAK?
Or does client recv neither ACK or NAK?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DORA + arp probe
non-authoritative srvr ignores req.
What is srvr's lease duration? S/b fixed assignment, inf duration.
	If you change it, does boot-eyes test result chg?
Does client send RELEASE req on shutdown?
	How does srvr react to request once client reboots?
Client attempts to renew after 1/2 lease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 IP addr alloc mechanisms: auto, dyn, manual. Eyes = manual, svc laptops=dyn.
Scn 1.6. Client config should retain across client (& srvr) reboot.
Scn 3.1 Admin may disable srvr probes of newly alloc'd addrs.
	Some clients may goto REQ (skip DISCOVER) on reboot. Does yours?
	Client times out & re-xmits DISCOVER if recv no reply.
	On no ack/nak, client may re-xmit REQ 4x for 60secs then revert to INIT.
Scn 3.2 Client wishing to reuse previous IP may omit DISCOVER and issue REQ.
	Client rexmits REQ if recvs neither ACK or NACK.
  	If client recvs NAK, it must return to INIT state.
	Client does not normally RELEASE on shutdown.
Scn 3.3. Time values (32bit seconds) are relative to client clock.
	But what if client clock jumps 45 years immediately after DHCP bound?
	Won't client consider lease expired?  Well, per dhclient(8) manpage:
	  Old leases are kept around in case the DHCP server is unavailable...
	  (... during the initial system boot process). In that event old leases
	  from the chclient.leases file which have not yet expired are tested...
	Well, these leases will all be in the future.
		client obtains lease at time 10, good til time 1e3.
		client ntpdate steps time to 1e6.
		client shuts down; dhclient saves lease
		client boots; time=1, sees lease not expired.
Scn 4.1. Client responsible for msg rexmit.
	Exponential backoff: delay 4, 8, 16, 32, 64sec (randomized +/- 1).
